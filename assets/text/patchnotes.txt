[b][u]Prototype 2 - 01/12/2023[/u][/b]
Quite a big update on both technical and feature levels.
We have a new engine, a bunch of gameplay and system additions as well as first new tileset to spice things up.

While there might be some growing pains due to porting to Godot and my limited experience with the engine I tried to keep them to minimum so the game stays playable and fun. Now, onto the changes!

[b]Added:[/b]
- 13 new levels
- difficulty settings: 3 default presets + customization
- new paddles: armed, curved, roguelike, bounce control
- new pickups: bouncy paddle, freeze paddle, sticky paddle, reverse controls, slow ball
- new breakables: chairs, explosives, fences, graves, pumpkins, tables
- new decorations: benches, bookcase, candle stand, paintings, windows, wardrobes
- new tileset: garden
- new visual effects
- player skill: screen shake (press {game_skill} during gameplay to shake the screen which randomly changes ball rotation and freezes paddle for a short time)
- game over screen
- local leaderboard
- localization support, partial localization for German, Japanese and Polish languages
- new user settings

[b]Changed:[/b]
- switched from Unity to Godot Engine
- ball collision improvements
- adjustments to original levels
- default tileset improvements
- UI layout and theming

[b]Fixed:[/b]
- fullscreen toggle doesn't update to loaded state
- weird ball collisions

[b]Known issues:[/b]
- stage music is fully randomized, might select the same song multiple times
- ball slides over paddle when colliding under very small angle
- some UI elements require mouse to navigate
- control settings partially obscured by category buttons when using German or Japanese language
- [Steam Deck] game is zoomed in, with about half of the window visible on screen
- continuous lack of gophers

[b]Important note:[/b]
If you played the Unity version (Prototype 1) make sure to remove the "DA-I0" folder created by the game. You can find it at:
- Linux: ~/.config/unity3d/unity3d/DA-I0
- Windows: C:\Users\<user_name>\AppData\LocalLow\DA-I0
