# Blockade of Gopher Keep
Simple prototype of a block breaker game made out of boredom.

Everything is a work in progress and/or placeholder (including the name).

## Features:
- 17 levels
- 4 paddles
- 12 pickups
- 3 default difficulty levels + customization
- local leaderboard
... and more(ish)

## Known issues:
- stage music is fully randomized, might select the same song multiple times
- lack of gophers
- ball slides over paddle when colliding under very small angle
