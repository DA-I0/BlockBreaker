Version 0.5:
	Features:
		Keep mode:
			☐ Map with a "tree" level progression (think Outrun, Shadow the Hedgehog)?
				☐ Each branch node consists of multiple levels
				☐ Each branch uses different tileset type?
				☐ Can't change a branch or use the store until all stages in the branch are completed
				☐ Can go back to previous branches?
			Scoring:
				☐ Player score counts per branch, overall high-score sums up those values
				☐ Replaying a branch can increase its score (replaces previous one rather than add to it)
			Boss fights:
				☐ Appear at the end of each branch node
				☐ Bosses can attack player (paddle) - attack can cause damage (life loss) or negative effects
			Store:
				☐ Various items to buy (lives, pickups, paddles etc?)
				☐ Available after each 5 levels or after boss fights
			☐ Multi-room levels (ball can travel to another room/screen, can be side-to-side or up-down)
				There are potential issues with room transition and handling edge casees like multiple balls. Maybe freeze all the interactables in the original room and keep one ball active between transitions?
			☐ Ability to switch active skill between stage branches
			☐ Ability to rebuild parts of the keep for coins to get bonuses
			☐ Chest items (drops coins and other Keep Mode limited items?)
			☐ Save/load system

					☐ Action
			☐ River (slightly changes ball direction)
			☐ Indestructible "breakables" (break to open and get a prize, in the form chests etc)
